# Project Roadmap

* Change to YAML-based config file
* Translation and forwarding between any SNMP versions (presently it translates all to v1)
    * Support one or more v3 destinations
* Pass-through mode (based on packet source IP - no translation/updates)
* More flexible filter-rule processing (including rule labels and jump/goto - instead of just sequential rules)
* API for runtime config and rule management
