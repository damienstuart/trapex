TRAPEX(8)
=========

NAME
----
trapex - An SNMP trap forwarder with filtering and translation capability


SYNOPSIS
--------
*trapex* [*-h*] [*-c* <config_file>] [*-b* <bind_ip>] [*-p* <listen_port>]
         [*-d*] [*-v*]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *trapex* program an SNMP Trap proxy/forwarder. It can receive, filter,
manipulate, log, and forward SNMP traps to zero or mulitple destinations.
It can receive and process SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3 traps.

*Trapex* is modeled after, and closely resembles a commercial product called
'eHealth Trap Exploder'.  The legacy 'trapexploder' program does not support
SNMP v3 traps, and may no longer be suppored. *Trapex* was written to provide
a suitable replacement for 'trapexploder'.

Presently, all v2c and v3 traps are converted to v1 before they are logged
and/or forwarded. Support for sending other versions may be added in a future
release.


ARGUMENTS
---------
The command-line arguments supported by *trapex* are optional if the *trapex*
configuration file is in it default location ('/etc/trapex.conf'), and the
remaining configuration options are set there.  Note that any options set
via the command-line will override their corresponding values in the
configuration file.

The options are as follows:

*-h*::
    Print a usage summary message and exit.

*-c* '</path/to/trapex.conf>'::
    Specify/override the location of the trapex configuration file. If not
    set, the default is */etc/trapex.conf"

*-b* '<bind_ip>'::
    By default, *trapex* will listen on all active interfaces for incoming
    traps. This option allow for specifying a specific IP on witch to listen.

*-p* '<port>'::
    Specify the UDP port on which to listen for incoming traps. The default is
    port 162.

*-d*::
    Enable 'debug' mode. This causes *trapex* to print very verbose information
    on the incoming traps as well as the trap log entries to STDOUT.

*-v*::
    Print the *trapex* version and exit.


TRAPEX CONFIGURATION FILE
-------------------------
The *trapex* configuration file ('trapex.conf') is used to set the various
runtime options as well as the filtering, forwarding, and logging directives.

Blank lines are allowed, and those that start with '"#"' are for comments.

There are 2 types of directives in the 'trapex.conf' file:

Configuration directives -:: 
    These are lines in the file that have *trapex* configuration options and
    their values. In most cases these line will have a parameter/option name
    and its corresponding value. Some directives (like 'debug') do not have 
    a value and are a boolean that is true when that entry is uncommented.

Filter directives - ::
    These are the lines that define a filter for matching incoming traps and
    specifying an 'action' for traps that match the filter.  All of these
    directives start with the word "'filter'".


CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES
------------------------

*_General Options:_*

*debug*::
    Enable 'debug' mode. This causes *trapex* to print very verbose information
    on the incoming traps as well as the trap log entries to STDOUT.

*listenAddress* '<bind_ip>'::
    Specify the IP address on which to bind to listen for incoming traps. When
    set to a specific IP, only traps coming in to the network interface that
    has that IP will be received and processed. If not specified here or on
    the command-line, the default is '0.0.0.0' (all IPs).

*listenPort* '<port>'::
    Specify the UDP port on which to listen for incoming traps. If not set
    here or on the command-line, the default is 162.

*_Log File Handling:_*

*logfileMaxSize* '<value in MB>'::
    Specify the maximum size in MB the log files can grow before they are
    rotated.

*logfileMaxBackups* '<value>'::
    Specify how many backup (rotated) log files to keep. Older backups beyond
    this number will be removed. The backup log files are renamed with a date-
    time stamp.

*compressRotatedLogs*::
    When uncommented, this option causes backup log files to be compressed
    with gzip after they are rotated.

*_SNMP v3 Setting_*

These are options for receiving SNMP v3 traps. Note that *trapex* currently
only supports the SNMP v3 'User-based Security Model' (USM).

*v3msgFlags* '<AuthPriv|AuthNoPriv|NoAuthNoPriv>'::
    This specifies the 'SNMP v3 Message Flags'. Currently, *Trapex* supports
    only the 'Auth' (Authentication) and 'Priv' (Privacy) flags. These are 
    set via a single string as follows:
	* *AuthPriv* - Authentication and privacy
	* *AuthNoPriv* - Authentication and no privacy
    * *NoAuthNoPriv* - No authentication, and no privacy

*v3User* '<username>'::
    Set the SNMP v3 username. This is required for v3.

*v3authProtocol* '<MD5|SHA>'::
    Set the SNMP v3 'authentication protocol'. Valid values are 'MD5' or
    'SHA' (default).  Note that this parameter is required if the Auth
    'Msg Flag' is set (v3msgFlags = 'AuthNoPriv' or 'AuthPriv').

*v3authPassword* '<password>'::
    Set the SNMP v3 authentication password. This is required if Auth
    mode is set.

*v3privProtocol* '<AES|DES>'::
    Set the SNMP v3 'authentication protocol'. Valid values are 'AES'
    (default) or 'DES'.  Note that this parameter is required if Priv mode
    'Msg Flag' is set (v3msgFlags = 'AuthPriv').

*v3authPassword* '<password>'::
    Set the SNMP v3 privacy password. This is required if Priv mode is set.


FILTER DIRECTIVES
-----------------

The *trapex* configuration 'filter' directives are used for specifying which
traps are processed and what action is taken for traps that match the filter.

Each 'filter' line starts with the word "'filter'" followed by the 'filter
expressions', the 'action' for that filter, and for some actions, an option
argument for that action.

*_Filter Expressions_*

The 'filter expression' is a space separated set of 5 filter criteria for trap
data fields in the following order:

*Source IP*:: 
    The source IP of the incoming trap packet.
    This can be a string match for a single IP address, a subnet in CIDR
    notation, or a regular expression.
*Agent Address*::
    The SNMNP v1 AgentAddr IP address.
    This can be a string match for a single IP address, a subnet in CIDR
    notation, or a regular expression.
*Generic Type*::
    The trap 'Generic Type' (integer: 0-6).
*Specific Type*::
    The trap 'Specific Type' (integer: 0-n).
*Enterprise OID*::
    The trap 'Enterprise OID' value. This uses a regulare expression for
    matching.

An asterisk (***) can be used as a wildcard to indicate that any value for
that field matches. For instance, a filter that would match all traps and
forward them to 192.168.1.1 port 162 would look like this:

..........................
filter * * * * * forward 192.168.1.1:162
..........................

If multiple fields are set to a non-wildcard value, then all of them have
to match (logical AND) in order for the trap to match and trigger the action.

*_Filter Actions_*

The 'actions' that are currenly supported by *trapex* are:

*forward* <ip_address:port>::
    Forward the trap to the specified IP address and port. *WARNING:* Do
    not specify the trapex host and port as a destination or you will
    create a trap forwarding loop!

*nat* <ip_address|$SRC_IP>::
    Set the trap 'AgentAddress' value to the specified IP address or use
    "'$SRC_IP'" to set it to the source IP of the trap packet.

*log* </path/to/log/file>::
    Save the trap data to the specified log file. Any files created by log
    actions are subject to the log file handling configuration directives.

*break*::
    The 'break' action means ignore this trap - do not forward it or take
    any other actions - just drop it.

*_Filter Processing_*

The order of the filter directives in the configuration file is important.

The filters are processed in the order they appear in the configuration
file. When a trap is received, it is checked against each filter in order. If
it matches a filter, the trap data is processed by the 'action' for that
filter, and that trap is checked against the next filter, and so on (unless
the action is 'break' - where the trap is dropped and ignored from that point
on).
