# Each plugin, by Golang 'plugin' library convention lives 
# in its own "package main" file.
# Practically speaking, this means that each plugin module code has to live
# in its own directory, or Golang tools get confused about which 'main'
# they need to be in.
#
# Each plugin type is separated out with its own directory structure,
# so we need to execute 'go build' in each directory.
