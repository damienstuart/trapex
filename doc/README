NOTES on the generation of the trapex man page:

Until we decide on a better way, the man pages for 'trapex' is generated from
the asciidoc sources in this directory.

We use the "a2x" command to generate the initial nroff-formated version,
which may need to be manually edited to clean it up a bit.  The "a2x" command
is:

    a2x -f manpage  trapex.man.asciidoc

    (note, in some cases, you may need to add the -L or --no-xmllint argument)
    
This creates the 'trapex.8' man page.  However, depending on the a2x and.or
asciidoc configuration on your system, you may have to edit the "trapex.8"
file directly to remove the '[FIXME: source/manual]' string embedded within.
At present, we simply remove them.  There may also be places where you want
items on successive line without intervening lines (i.e. the AUTHORS section
of the generated man page).  In those cases, simply change the ".sp"
between those lines to ".br".

For creating HTML versions of the man pages, simply use the "-f xhtml"
option to the "a2x" command:

    a2x -f xhtml trapex.man.asciidoc
